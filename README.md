This repositry is based on a article by Hristo Georgiev, I reworked it to work on the react_on_rails gem instead of the react_rails. 
https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/ruby-ruby-on-rails/building-a-crud-interface-with-react-and-ruby-on-rails

NB: I will be posting an tutorial on https://medium.com/@stefanmostert soon explaining this repositry in more detail.
